<h2>Stream search</h2>
<p>This web app is a platform which allows users to search for movies in order to fin out which streaming service offers them. If a movie is not listed a user can add it themself.
    Users provide all the website content. Users add movies and then vote on which platform they are availiable to be streamed on. In this fashion
    movies are "self updated". Provided a large enough user base the site should demostrate reasonable accuracy (wisdom of crowds).

<p> TODO:

    I will eventually add a 'flag' feature to allow users to flag innapropriate or incorrect information so that a moderator may take it down.
