I think the most interesting component of CS is Machine Learning or other AI applications. Web apps are pretty rad too. I think they are cool because we can write some code and create something that can be used by other people. I hope that I can fill this website with functional as well as useful web app in the near future."

Users provide all the website content. Users add movies and then vote on which platform they are availiable to be streamed on. In this fashion movies are updated. Provided a large enough user base the site should demostrate reasonable accuracy (wisdom of crowds)."

      "description": "Contrusted an LSTM to predict how the public may percive a song. Inputing textual reviews of albums we then trained our model to ascertain whihc words are positive, negative or neutral. It is from this analysis that we are able to predict a corresponding score of how well a song may be recireved. In the future we would like to implement it so that it can predict hit songs from comments on platforms like youtube or soundcloud. "
