I think the most interesting component of CS is Machine Learning or other AI applications. Web apps are pretty rad too. I think they are cool because we can write some code and create something that can be used by other people. I hope that I can fill this website with functional as well as useful web app in the near future."

If a movie is not listed a user can add it themself. Users provide all the website content. Users add movies and then vote on which platform they are availiable to be streamed on. In this fashion movies are updated. Provided a large enough user base the site should demostrate reasonable accuracy (wisdom of crowds)."
